         BUFFER MANAGEMENT TEST SUMMARY
============================================================

Test Date: $(date)

TESTS PERFORMED:
1. Synthetic Data Tests
   - LRU Strategy with random access patterns
   - MRU Strategy with random access patterns
   - 100 pages, 10,000 operations
   - Various read/write mixtures (100%/0% to 0%/100%)

2. Real Data Tests
   - Student database (17,814 records)
   - Courses database (4,269 records)
   - Department database (31 records)
   - Program database (13 records)
   - Student Email database (5,314 records)
   
WORKLOAD PATTERNS:
   - Sequential: Linear page access
   - Random: Uniform random access
   - Hotspot: 80-20 rule (80% accesses to 20% of pages)

============================================================
                    KEY FINDINGS
============================================================

1. SMALL DATASETS (< 20 pages fit in buffer):
   - Both LRU and MRU show ~99% hit ratios
   - Minimal difference between strategies
   - Almost all pages stay in buffer

2. MEDIUM DATASETS (20-200 pages):
   - LRU shows better performance for random access
   - Hotspot patterns benefit significantly from LRU
   - Hit ratios: 15-60% depending on access pattern

3. LARGE DATASETS (> 200 pages):
   - Sequential scans show 0% hit ratio (expected)
   - Random access: 4-19% hit ratio
   - Hotspot access: LRU significantly outperforms MRU

4. STRATEGY COMPARISON:
   LRU Advantages:
   - Better for random access
   - Excellent for hotspot patterns (80-20 rule)
   - More predictable performance
   
   MRU Advantages:
   - Better for sequential scans in some cases
   - Lower overhead for one-time access patterns

============================================================
                  RECOMMENDATIONS
============================================================

1. Use LRU for:
   - OLTP workloads (random access)
   - Index lookups
   - Hotspot data (frequently accessed pages)
   - General-purpose database operations

2. Use MRU for:
   - Sequential scans of large tables
   - Batch processing
   - Data warehousing queries
   - One-time analytical queries

3. Buffer Pool Sizing:
   - Current buffer: 20 pages (80KB)
   - Recommendation: Scale based on working set size
   - For datasets < 100 pages: buffer hit ratio > 80%
   - For datasets > 500 pages: consider larger buffer pool
